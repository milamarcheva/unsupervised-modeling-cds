# unsupervised-modeling-cds
Cognitive biases incorporated in Percy Liang's unsupervised modeling toolkit (https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/software/).

Please note that the foundational code in this repository is from Percy Liang, and is available in its original variant on https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/software/

I augment the code with 3 cognitively plausible factors: order, gradual unlcoking, and priming, which can be used independently or together with the HMM model. 

I provide scripts for running various trainings as well as for evaluation. 

If you use this repository, please cite *in press*.
